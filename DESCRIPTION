Description: Knowledge transfer is computationally challenging, due in part to the curse of dimensionality. Recent work on manifold learning has shown that data collected in real-world settings often have high-dimensional representations butlie on low-dimensional manifolds. It is critical to align these data sets and extract this common structure. The idea and theoretical formulation is from https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ccarey/pubs/ManifoldWarping.pdf.
